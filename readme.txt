A project for the parallel computations for larg scale problems course.

The goal is to implement a distributed Conway's Game of Life and to analyse
the performance with different number of processors and data size. 

Parameters of the program are Nx Ny Nz MaxIter

Nx/Ny/Nz are the globaldata dimensions
MaxIter number of iterations to make.
